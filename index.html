            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">On any given school day, over 1 billion children around the world head to class. More children and adolescents today are enrolled in pre-primary, primary and secondary education than ever before. Yet, for many of them, schooling does not lead
                to learning – and this was before COVID-19 shuttered schools and disrupted learning across the globe, creating an urgent need to reimagine education. A lack of trained teachers, inadequate learning materials, makeshift classes and poor
                sanitation facilities make learning difficult for many children. Others come to school too hungry, sick or exhausted from work or household tasks to benefit from their lessons.The consequences are grave: An estimated 617 million children
                and adolescents around the world are unable to reach minimum proficiency levels in reading and mathematics, even though two thirds of them are in school. This learning crisis is the greatest global challenge to preparing children and adolescents
                for life, work and active citizenship.What’s more, 11 per cent of primary-school-aged children and 20 per cent of lower-secondary-aged children are not in school at all. Children and adolescents are excluded from education for many reasons.
                Poverty remains one of the most obstinate barriers, with children from the poorest households almost five times more likely to be out of primary school than those from the richest. Children with disabilities and from ethnic minorities
                are also more likely to be left behind.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Online education enables the teacher and the student to set their own learning pace, and there's the added flexibility of setting a schedule that fits everyone's agenda. As a result, using an online educational platform allows for a better
                balance of work and studies, so there's no need to give anything up,Studying online teaches you vital time management skills, which makes finding a good work-study balance easier. Having a common agenda between the student and teacher
                can also prompt both parties to accept new responsibilities and have more autonomy. In a space as vast and wide as the internet, there are infinite skills and subjects to teach and learn. A growing number of universities and higher education
                schools are offering online versions of their programs for various levels and disciplines. From music composition to quantum physics, there are options for every type of student. Studying your program online is also a great option for
                getting an official certificate, diploma, or degree without physically setting foot on a university campus.
